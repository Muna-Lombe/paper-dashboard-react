Create a React component called "CourseScraper" with the following features and states:

1. A card layout with a header containing an input field for a URL, a "Connect" button, and a "Reset" button.
2. A main content area that changes based on the following states:
a. Initial state (no link, not authenticated): Show an auth form with brief instructions.
b. Loading state: Display a loading spinner when a link is being processed.
c. Authenticated without link: Show an upward-pointing arrow animation with text "Add your link there".
d. Link loaded and authenticated: Display an iframe with the loaded content.
e. Link loaded but not authenticated: Show the iframe with a semi-transparent auth overlay.
3. A persistent "BookDetails" section at the top of the content area, containing read-only inputs for Book ID, Book Name, and User ID (hidden on mobile), and a Save button.
4. The auth form should include:

1. Email and password inputs
2. A submit button that shows a loading spinner when authenticating
3. Explanatory text about the temporary nature of the login



5. Use React hooks for state management (useState, useEffect).
6. Implement the following functions:

1. handleLoadLink: Process the entered URL and update the state
2. handleReset: Clear the current state and return to initial view
3. handleAuth: Process the login and update authentication state
4. handleSave: Save the current book details (just console.log for now)



7. Use Tailwind CSS for styling, including responsive design.
8. Incorporate icons from Lucide React for visual enhancements.
9. Ensure the component is responsive, with special consideration for mobile view (e.g., hiding certain elements, adjusting layouts).
10. Use shadcn/ui components where applicable for a modern, consistent UI.
11. Implement proper loading and disabled states for buttons.
12. Use session storage to persist some data across page reloads.


The component should provide a seamless user experience for loading course content, authenticating users, and saving book details, with clear visual feedback for each state and action
